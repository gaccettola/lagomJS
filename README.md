# lagomJS: a mysql-centric data access tool

Lagom (pronounced [ˈlɑ̀ːɡɔm]) is a Swedish word meaning "just the right amount". The Lexin Swedish-English dictionary defines lagom as "enough, sufficient, adequate, just right". Lagom is also widely translated as "in moderation", "in balance", "perfect-simple", and "suitable" (in matter of amounts).

LagomJS's goal is to help you keep your database scripts to updated and to get data from your database. This is not an ORM, it's a bit more than a query tool - our goal is to do just enough, then get out of your way. and the inspired, creative way you can use it's modern SQL functionality to work with your data.
