# lagomJS: a mysql-centric data access tool

LagomJS's goal is to **help** you get data from your database. This is not an ORM, it's a bit more than a query tool - our goal is to do just enough, then get out of your way. and the inspired, creative way you can use it's modern SQL functionality to work with your data.
